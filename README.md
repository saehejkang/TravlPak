 # Getting Setup:

In a new folder on the terminal run:
```bash
git init
git clone https://github.com/saehejkang/TravlPak.git
```

Next go into the directory created and then into folder with package.json:
```bash
cd TravlPak
cd travlpak
```
Once in this folder run:
```bash
npm i
```
This is to install of the dependencies needed to make the application work. Missing this step will cause compilation errors.

Finally:
```bash
npm start
```
And you should have the app opening up a window in your default browser to localhost:3000 which the application will be running on.
